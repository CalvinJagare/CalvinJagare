# 👋 Hey, I'm Calvin Jägare

Full-stack developer from Sweden, focused on building practical tools, internal platforms, and data-driven products.  
I like taking vague ideas, turning them into well-structured systems, and shipping things that people actually use.

---

## What I do

- **From idea to production** – I’m comfortable owning a project end-to-end: requirements, architecture, APIs, data, and UI.
- **Full-stack with a .NET core** – Most of my work is in C#/.NET, Blazor, and SQL Server, but I’m happy across the whole stack.
- **Data & automation** – I enjoy building flows that glue systems together: user -> automation -> database -> dashboards.
- **Product mindset** – I care about users, not just code. Clean architecture is important, but it has to ship.

---

## Focus areas

- **Web apps & portals** – Customer portals, internal tools, admin dashboards.
- **Data platforms & KPIs** – Collecting, cleaning, and visualizing data so teams can make decisions.
- **Process automation** – Connecting APIs and services to remove manual work.
- **Developer experience** – Structured repos, sensible conventions, and documentation that future-me will thank me for.

## How I work

- **Clear scope first** – I like to understand the problem, constraints, and success criteria before touching code.
- **Iterative delivery** – Ship something small, validate, then extend. Feedback > guessing.
- **Clean, typed, testable** – I prefer strongly typed APIs, clear boundaries, and tests where they add real value.
- **Documentation & handover** – Good handover and docs so others can maintain and extend the system.
